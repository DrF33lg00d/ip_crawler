# ip_crawler
IP crawler, Quick&Dirty

It's just testing some libs, like smtp, lxml, requests (maybe BS4, but I'm not sure).
Also I'll add another website for parsing IP, multiple mail_to ([k1@l.com, k2@l.com, ...]).
This code is not brilliant, so accept the fact that there is. Or make a pull request, you're welcome :D
